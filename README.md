# reportportal-agent-jest

A Jest reporter that uploads the results to a [ReportPortal](http://reportportal.io/) server.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save-dev reportportal-agent-jest
```

## Usage
In your jest config section of `package.json`, add the following entry:
```JSON
{
    "jest": {
        ...
        "reporters": [
            "reportportal-agent-jest",
            {
                "endpoint": "https://your.reportportal.server/api/v1",
                "project": "YourReportPortalProjectName",
                "launchname": "YourLauncherName",
                "tags": ["Ninja","YourCoolTag"]
            }
        ],
        ...
    }
}
```

First configure your ReportPortal access token, then start Jest:

```shell
$ export RP_TOKEN=<your_secure_token>
$ jest
```

It's also possible to override parameters `launchname`, `project` and `tags` defined in `package.json` by using environment variables, it's important to mention that environment variables has precedence over `package.json` definition.

```shell
$ export RP_LAUNCH_NAME=MY_COOL_LAUNCHER
$ export RP_PROJECT_NAME=MY_AWESOME_PROJECT
$ export RP_TAGS="MyTag,Ninja,CustomTag"
```
This for your convenience in case you has a continuous job that run your tests and may post the results pointing to a different Report Portal definition of project or launcher name or even dynamic tags, it's important to split it using comma (,).
